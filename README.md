*Lab for LPNU Web Technologies and Web Design course*

In this exciting project, we're diving into the world of web development to create a dynamic and interactive chat application using WebSocket technology. Say goodbye to the delays of traditional HTTP requests â€“ with WebSockets, messages flow instantly, providing a seamless real-time chatting experience.

Our project is all about building a virtual space where users can exchange messages in real-time.
